                These are the terms and conditions that every member of KC
                Winners must follow to enjoy the contribution scheme and get
                their full reward:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contribution:</strong> You must contribute
                        ₦2,000 every week for 30 weeks (7 months) — payment must
                        be made on or before every Thursday.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Registration Fee:</strong> First-time
                        registration (activation) is ₦3,500 — this opens your
                        first (primary) contribution account.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Extra Accounts:</strong> Adding another
                        contribution account costs ₦3,000 each — this money will
                        be taken straight from your wallet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wallet Funding:</strong> Your contributions are
                        deducted from your wallet automatically every Thursday —
                        make sure your wallet has money before Thursday to avoid
                        missing a payment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Defaults (Missed Payments):</strong> If you miss
                        a weekly payment, you must pay double the total amount
                        owed before your account can be considered up to date.
                        <br />
                        You can clear your defaults anytime — during the 30-week
                        contribution period or even after you finish
                        contributing — but you must clear them before you can
                        withdraw your payout.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Referrals:</strong> Every account must have at
                        least one referral within 3 months of activation or
                        account creation to get foodstuff incentives at the end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Referral Code:</strong> Your referral is tied to
                        your account. Either get a new person to register with
                        your referral code or open another account with your own
                        code to meet the requirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Money Transfer Between Members:</strong> You
                        cannot send money to another person’s account — every
                        member must complete their own contributions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Large Accounts:</strong> If you are running 50
                        accounts or more, you must complete payments in 4 parts
                        as agreed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Death or Emergency:</strong> If a member dies or
                        something serious happens, the Next of Kin must finish
                        the contributions and pay any defaults within one month
                        (4 weeks) of reporting to the organization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Refunds:</strong> ⚠️ No refund of money will
                        be given if you break any of these rules.
                    </li>
